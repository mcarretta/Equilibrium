# Equilibrium
## Hvis lyset tar oss.
Equilibrium is a game developed for the Video game Design and Programming course at the Politecnico di Milano

It is a First-Person Survival Horror based on the parsimonious usage of light as a precious resource to both see and fight enemies, adding to the mix a stealth and strategic approach.

Developed using Unity 3D and C#. For the sound designing Logic Pro was used.
